# JavaScriptPokerGame
A simple JavaScript poker game that will create a deck of 52 cards, shuffle the deck, deal 5 cards to one player and rank the player's hand. I am currently working on creating functionality that will allow the player to choose if they want 1 or 2 new cards for their hand. 

Currently, I have all output from the game showing up in the console.
